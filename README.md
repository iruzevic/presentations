## Make a CSS sandwich by using postCSS as a bread
#### 14.02.2017 - Js Talks #5

I like to think of it as being like the bread you use to make a sandwich. By itself it doesnâ€™t seem like much, but with an infinite variety of fillings that gives you something amazing. Explore how to setup, install plugins and some cool examples. Write less and get more.

## Frontend development - how to start and what to learn
#### 22.04.2017 - WebCamp 2017, Ljubljana

As a rookie in front-end development, you may ask yourself where to start and what to learn? Basics, frameworks, HTML, CSS, Javascript, pixel perfect, responsive and so on. A lot of big words to confuse and discourage you. Have no fear.

#### What will the audience get:
I'll walk you through some of the basics, tell you where to start, what to learn, in what order, and how to make your life less confusing than it already is. We will not be doing any coding, just general understanding what is a front-end developer and what it's skill sets are.

## To jQuery or not to jQuery
#### 13.07.2017 - Maribor JSTalks

Let us walk down the road less traveled and see how we can develop JavaScript without jQuery, but armed instead with the understanding of how vanilla JavaScript really works. Together we'll learn how to avoid the jQuery trap that many new and hobbyist web developers fall into, and see how we can benefit from going back to the JS roots instead.

#### What will the audience get:
Comparison of code in Vanilla JS vs jQuery, a brief history of the jQuery library and general advice on where and why to use it.
